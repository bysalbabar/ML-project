This project is a machine learning–based system that allows users to upload resumes in PDF format and automatically evaluates their quality. Text is extracted from the PDF resumes, preprocessed using NLP techniques, and converted into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF. The trained ML model then classifies the resume into categories such as Poor, Average, or Good, helping users quickly assess resume quality and areas for improvement.
